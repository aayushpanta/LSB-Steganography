# LSB-Steganography
Hide short messages inside an image using a key.

### To run this app...   
You can download this repository or file 'with rsa.py'

If you've downloaded only 'with rsa.py' file, uncomment following two lines(lines 376 and 377) within file 'with rsa.py' for the first run of this application   
#connect1()   
#create_table1()   

This will create database file 'mydb.db'. Then comment those lines again

P.S. RSA algorithm has been used for encryption of messages in this program, hence the name.

# Instructions to use the application
